General
- implement unittests: fi: test with a blacklisted id and see if the program doen't break. Testing changes to the code
  can show fast if there is a bug. (see also @coverage on http://mg.pov.lt/profilehooks/)
- when to use underscore?


Scraper
- implement a lock on the pageid. Different processes can run without scraping the same page.
- rewrite. The class/function is not ideal. Better make a post class with a mongo page json and functions to feed it.
- implement cron jobs to automate scraping
- is profile always the samme as from? Why this doesn't work? db.getCollection('facebook').find({'profile.id':{'$ne':'from.id'}},{'profile.id':1,'from.id':1})
- formulate a strategy to capture updates of posts without the need to redownload everything again. (ex. when someone comments on a past post).
- improve restart method.
  teller is obsolete.
  when internet connection crash, best is to have an exponentialy increasing waiting time. With a blacklist crash, the best is 0 waiting time, and no teller.
